## Welcome to the homepage of Yuyi Zhong

My name is Yuyi, and I am a Ph.D. candidate at [School of Computing, National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) (NUS). Currently, I am under the supervision of Associate Professor [KHOO Siau Cheng](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/khoosc/) to analyze and verify the safety and security of neural networks.

Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) (HUST), China in 2018 where I worked in software security including vulnerability detection.

### Research

My research interests lie in applying formal methods used in program analysis to neural network verification. Currently, I am focusing on a research project of building a configurable neural network verification platform that enables quick and systematic construction and experimentation of network analyses. 
To do so, we first build a verification tool BBPoly that enables fast but efficient network verification with limited computational resources. 
Our second work constructs a verification method ARENA that conducts both robustness verification and falsification effectively and efficiently.
The third work focuses on a pre-processing technique REDNet before the verification process, which generates a reduced network that helps accelerate the subsequent verification.
My current ongoing work is optimization-based network verification on GPU, in collaboration with Dr. Hanping Xu and Shaun Tan.
