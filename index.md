## Welcome to the homepage of Yuyi Zhong

My name is Yuyi and I am a Ph.D candidate at [School of Computing, National University of Singgapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) (NUS). Currently, I am under the supervision of Associate Professor [KHOO Siau Cheng](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/khoosc/) to analyze and verify the safety and security of neural networks.

Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) (HUST), China in 2018 where I worked in software security including vulnerability detection.

I can be reached at: yuyizhong@comp.nus.edu.sg.

### Research

My research interests lie in applying formal methods used in program analysis to neural network verification. Currently, I am focusing on a research project of building a configurable neural network verification platform that enables quick and systematic construction and experimentation of network analyses. 
To do so, we first build a verification tool BBPoly that enables fast but efficient network verificatoin with limited computational resources. 
Our second work constructs a verification method ARENA that conducts both robustness verification and falsificatoin effectively and efficiently.
The ongoing work focuses on a sound and complete verifier that scales up to handle larger networks.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JacksonZyy/yuyizhong.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
